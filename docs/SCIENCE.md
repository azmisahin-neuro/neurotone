# Scientific Background

## Brain Waves
Human brain activity exhibits measurable electrical rhythms:

- Delta (0.5–4 Hz)
- Theta (4–8 Hz)
- Alpha (8–12 Hz)
- Beta (12–30 Hz)
- Gamma (30+ Hz)

These are measured using EEG (Electroencephalography).

## Neural Entrainment
Neural entrainment refers to the brain’s tendency to synchronize
its electrical activity with external rhythmic stimuli.

---

## Isochronic Tones
Isochronic tones are single tones that turn on and off at a
specific frequency.

Studies indicate they can induce stronger EEG responses
compared to binaural beats.

---

## Limitations
- No DNA alteration
- No medical treatment claims
- Effects vary between individuals
